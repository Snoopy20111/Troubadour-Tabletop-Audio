Howdy! Thanks for giving the Music Bot a try.

Here's a quick guide to setting up this bot. It's not too difficult, but not as easy as many other bots. More information can also be found at the D++ page on creating a Bot Token (https://dpp.dev/creating-a-bot-application.html).

1) Go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and log in with your Discord account.

2) Make a New Application and Bot.
	- Click the button to make a New Application.
	- Give it whatever name you like. You can always change it later.
	- On the panel to the left, go to "Bot," and in the "Build-A-Bot" section of the page select "Add Bot."
	- In the new options that appeared, set your bot's username. This is how it will appear in your list of server members.

3) Generate a Token.
	- Click the new button that says "Reset Token." You will likely need to enter your password again or use 2-Factor-Authentication.
	- You'll be given a token. DO NOT SHARE THIS, it is essentially the keys to the related bot account!
	- In your Troubadour folder (wherever you put it), find the file token.config. Open it in a text editor like Notepad, and delete any contents.
	- Copy and Paste your token here. Don't add any spaces or other characters, or the bot will fail to work.
	- Save your token.config file.

4) Generate an invite link with permissions.
	- Go to the OAuth2 tab on the left of the Dev Portal.
	- Scroll down to the OAuth2 URL Generator.
	- Check the scope "bot." Another section will appear below. Check the text permissions "send messages" and voice Permissions "Connect" and "Speak."
	- At the very bottom, copy the Generated URL, and paste it in a new tab of your browser.
	- A window will appear to choose what server to invite it to. Do so, then click "Authorize."

6) Start the program.
	- Go to the server in your Discord client which you invited the bot to. You should see it in the list of users, named with the username you set in step 2.
	- Run Troubadour.exe. A console output window should appear, and in Discord the bot will appear to come online.

That's it! From there you can start giving it slash commands, authoring events from the included FMOD Studio project for it, and playing that audio for everybody present. To close the bot, I recommend using the /quit command, but you can also just close the console window and kick the bot from any Voice Chats it's in.

Have fun!
